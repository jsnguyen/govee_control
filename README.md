# Govee Control

* Super simple GUI for my controller using `PySimpleGUI`.
* I've attached a MacOS application that just runs a script that runs the gui so it can go on the dock.
* You need the virtual environment for the script to work.
* You also need an API key. The contents of `api_key.toml` should look like:
```
key = "API KEY HERE"
```
